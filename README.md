# Know Drowsy 
## ðŸ¤” The Problem
The National Highway Safety Administration estimates 
that drowsy driving results in 1,550 deaths and 71,000 injuries 
and more than 1,00,000 accidents per year in India. 
Around 21 percent of fatal accidents around the world 
occur due to the driver falling asleep. The numbers are 
eye-catching. Falling asleep at the wheel is not only fatal 
for the driver but also puts the lives of the other people 
in the car or on the streets at risk. Know Drowsy aims to 
prevent such accidents by alerting the passengers in the car.
## ðŸ’¡ The Idea
Know Drowsy is an Android application that 
detects if a driver is drowsy. The application has 
been developed using machine learning techniques. 
The app uses the phoneâ€™s camera which points 
directly at the driverâ€™s face and monitors the 
driverâ€™s facial activities and eye movements, 
in case fatigue is detected and an alert is provided. 
The purpose of this app is to aid the prevention of 
accidents that are recurrent is passenger and commercial vehicles. 
The app detects the early signs of drowsiness before the 
driver has fully lost attentiveness.
